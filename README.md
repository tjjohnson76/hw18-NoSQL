# hw18-NoSQL: Social Network API

In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a mongoose based social media backend. In this application we were to create Users and Thoughts. Users also have an array of friends in the model which reference different user's ids. Thoughts also have an array that mentions a separate reaction schema in the thought model. I recieved a lot of help with the getters and the formatDate function from the linked repo below. Both Users and Thoughts have the 4 CRUD methods for the api calls. The reactions and the friends have the create and delete operations associated with them.
